After finishing my undergrad thesis, it's time to come back to this game.

I started trying to do a similar approach to what I had done with the units of weight
in the previous projects, however it was hard to just use an array with units because
with the date object there is no one pattern of units, some are singular, some are 
plural, some like the day should be done with date instead of day, or the year should
be with getFullYear, etc.

At first I thought that I'd have to just add all methods manually, but then I did
it with an array of objects where I define what string to use for get, what for set and what for
add so that it can be done with a look with no trouble.
