For this problem I worked on implementing a different code structure. This idea was taken from
the course portal from the academy. I saw that for handling the same event in different actions
what Chris does is defining a _handles_ object with each of the functions and then
giving the needed handler in the data attribute of the element. I think the code
structure looks good.

Additionally, I had difficulties in counting correctly the words because when 
you add a newline, the newline character didn't split the words and they 
counted as a single word. I think it could have been handled with a Regular Expression,
but I don't want to get into that, so I did it with a `String.replaceAll` that changes new lines
with spaces and then filtering empty strings from the array which could appear in some places
if the value ended with a whitespace or if i had more than 1 whitespace together.

**Edit:** Someone pinted in Slack that it wasn't working and it turned out to be that his browser
didn't support the replaceAll method. I added a polyfill just in case I think it is
a good opportunity to get a little into this. I placed the polyfill at the end of the script basically
because I want the first and most important part to be the solution itself, I'm almost sure that
this works given that the method only fires when the event occurs and that is after the
script has already been parsed, however I'm not sure if maybe I should add it in the 
beginning. I have no old browser to test. In the end I think for this case it would
end up being easier to just change the method to the regex method.
