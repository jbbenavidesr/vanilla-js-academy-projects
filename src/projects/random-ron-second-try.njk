In the first attempt I knew It was a little crappy, but it got the job done. However,
I wanted a really good app, so I read other's solutions and also Chris' recommendations
and this is my new solution.

I want to point out the main points I like about this:

- It is progressively enhanced, so if JS doesn't load, it shows a quote and a message.
With Javascript I render the button and update to actually get a random quote from the 
begining.
- It is accessible, it has the aria live in the quote to read it when it changes. (Tested)
- I'm started to get the feel of this code structure, I like it and it helps me get
my code a little organized.
