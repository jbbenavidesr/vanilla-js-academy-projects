{% endset %}

{% set description %}
I had a lot of trouble with this one, but not with the problem itself, eleventy
wasn't rendering the page appropriately.

I changed to the method used by chris of letting the user customize the message
with a string instead of a function, however, using the templating with double
curly brackets broke the build. I don't know why. 

I had to change to use a single curly bracket for the template, I guess it works fine.
{% endset %}

{% include "project.njk" %}
