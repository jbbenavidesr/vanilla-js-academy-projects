{% set description %}
I really like what's coming in this final part of the academy. This idea of working
with libraries allow me to have my code ready for using in multiple cases and gives me
much more structure. 

I basically tried to do a wrapper that would work with this API so it is a library
where the user provides the API key and the library handles the fetch and updates the
UI by using an element with `data-weather` attribute. I think it's nice for it to be
my first approach to libraries. I also tried to make clear documentation and comments.
